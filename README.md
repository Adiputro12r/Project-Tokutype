# Project-Tokutype
The Japanese Typing Challenge Web Game helps users practice typing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji using romaji input. Each letter is checked in real timeâ€”correct ones turn green, and mistakes turn red. It tracks WPM, progress, and supports thousands of words. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS for a simple, responsive design.
